# Create a Model Training Workflow in Plain Python

In this first example, we're going to create a simple model training
workflow in plain Python using the wine dataset and sklearn. As you can see,
we define three functions for getting data, processing data, and training a
model, which we put together into a function called `training_workflow`.
